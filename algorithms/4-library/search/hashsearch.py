    SEARCH-002
    In Hash-Based Search the n elements of a collection C are first
    loaded into a hash table H with b bins structured as an array.
    This pre-processing step has O(n) performance. Once all elements
    have been inserted, searching for an item t becomes a search for
    t within H[hash(t)].

    The size of H is typically chosen to be a prime number to ensure
    that using the % modulo operator efficiently distributes the
    computed bin numbers (2**k - 1).
