    SORT-004
    Bucket sort is good when drawing from a universally dense set. A good
    example is sorting floats in range(0, 1) which is assumed by this
    algorithm. Basic idea is to not use comparison between elements as the
    basis for sorting but instead to use the elements as keys into a hash map
    which can then be combined into the output sorted array.

    Use in the following conditions:

    1. Uniform model distribution. N buckets are created to evenly
    partition the input range.
    2. Ordered hash function. The buckets are ordered.

    Given a set of n elements, Bucket Sort constructs a set of n
    ordered buckets into which the elements of the input set are
    partitioned.

    Average: O(n)
    Worst: O(n)
    Best: O(n)

    :param arr: input list will be sorted in place.
