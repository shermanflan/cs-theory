def intersects(r):
    """
    Let (x1, y1) be the location of the bottom-left corner of R1 and
    (x2, y2) be the location of its top-right corner. Similarly, let
    (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) be the respective corner locations for R2.
    The intersection of R1 and R2 will be a rectangle R3 whose bottom-
    left corner is at (max(x1, x3), max(y1, y3)) and top-right corner
    at (min(x2, x4), min(y2, y4)). If max(x1, x3) > min(x2, x4) or
    max(y1, y3) > min(y2, y4) then R3 does not exist, ie R1 and R2 do
    not intersect.
